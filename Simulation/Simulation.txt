What do I want with the simulation:
	- Number of individuals infected over time
	- Distance matrix


While there are infected points:
	- Gather information:
		- Count the infected
		- Update static distance matrix
	
	- Move
	- Update infected
	- Update recovered

Move:
	- Generate new coordinates



Class Simulation:
	Map of points been usend <=> map:{(x,y) :[points]} pos_to_point
	Map of number to points map <=> map:{0: point, 1:point, 2:point} point_to_pos
	List of infected, recovered, susceptible


Setup:
	# Create points
	for i in range(n):
		Generate random coordinates x,y
		map[(flor(x), floor(y))] = i
		map[i] = (x,y)

	# Set infected ones
	for i in range(porcentage * n):
		infected = rand()%n

Move:
	Generate new x,y
	update pos_to_point:
		removo da lista antiga
		adiciono na nova

	update point_to_pos:
		atualizar coordenada

Infect:
	for every point in infected:
		look around in pos_to_point
		if found, move with certain prob
